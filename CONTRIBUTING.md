# Pull Request Order
Each pull request should contain only one change. This means that pull requests like "fix: many fixes" are not accepted; it's preferable to submit separate pull requests, each with specific, even small, changes.

# Commit
Commits must adhere to the conventions of conventional commits and commit linting.

Thank you for your willingness to contribute <3
